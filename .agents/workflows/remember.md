# /remember — Persistent Memory Management

$ARGUMENTS

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL RULES

1. **Load memory-system skill** — Read `.agents/skills/memory-system/SKILL.md` first
2. **Never auto-delete memories** — Always ask user before pruning
3. **Keep index under 200 lines** — Warn if approaching limit
4. **Distill, don't copy** — Save insights, not full conversations

---

## Task

Use the `memory-system` skill to save information:

```
CONTEXT:
- User wants to remember: $ARGUMENTS
- Memory location: .agents/memory/

WORKFLOW:
1. CLASSIFY the information type: user | feedback | project | reference
2. CHECK if relevant topic file exists in .agents/memory/
3. SAVE to appropriate topic file (create if needed)
4. UPDATE .agents/memory/MEMORY.md index with one-line pointer
5. CONFIRM to user what was saved

RULES:
1. Follow memory-system/SKILL.md taxonomy
2. Keep index entries under 150 characters
3. Topic files must have frontmatter (type, created, updated)
4. Don't save information derivable from code
5. Don't save temporary debug context
```

---

## Expected Output

```
[OK] Saved to memory

Type: [user/feedback/project/reference]
File: .agents/memory/[topic-file].md
Entry: [one-line summary of what was saved]

This will be available in future sessions.
```
